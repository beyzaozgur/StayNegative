A 3D Covid Escape Game built in Unity using C# coded by Group Zerone (Beyza Özgür, Beyza Nur Gören, Yağmur Akbaba)

## About The Game
When you open the project, you need to run the "Start" scene, that is under the asset folder. After running the project, you are going to see that you need to choose 
the character which you want to play. There are 2 different characters: Ethane and Doctor. If you choose Ethane, you can spin around(rotate) but if you choose doctor, you can’t. Also Doctor can go back but Ethan can’t. After that, level1 is going to start. Arrow keys and space bar are using to move the character. 

In Level1, covid balls are falling randomly from the sky an player need to escape from them to stay negative. There are 3 healths and if the player touches the covid ball, it decreases with 1 point. Also if the player collects the disinfectants, he/she gains 1 health point. In addition, when the player falls from the hill and touches the water he/she dies. Player's aim is arriving to the hospital. There is a vaccine in front of the hospital. We are going to level2 after touching the vaccine.

Before going to Level2, there is a choose enemy scene and it has 2 buttons: Enemy Ethane and Infected Person. The enemy that you choosed is going to be a covid positive person. 
	
Level2 has 3 parts: Forest area, jumping area and fire area. It starts with the forest area. There are trees and bushes in the first part. Also covid positive person is chasing you. While infected person chasing you, it throws covid balls and you need to also escape from them. Player has 3 healths for the covid balls again but this time there is no disinfectants. If you caught by the covid positive person, you die. After escaping from the infected person and covid balls, player arrives to the jumping area. There are columns to jump and pass the jumping area. Player need to be careful not to fall because if he/she falls, he dies. And then, it arrives the last part, fire area. There are fires and player needs to pass them without touching. If player touches them, he/she dies. He/she can jump or go around of fires. In the end of the road, there is a hospital and a vaccine. When player touches the vaccine, game ends succesfully and "Win" scene is appearing.	
	"Game Over" scene is coming if the player dies because of the fires or falling from the hill.
	"You are infected" scene is coming if the player dies because of the covid positive person or 3 touches by the covid balls.
	"Win", "Game Over" and "You are infected" scenes have 2 buttons. They are "Quit" and "Restart". If you click on the "Restart" button, game start from the "Start" scene.
